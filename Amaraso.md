# The Porcupine's Blood {#english}

The cub of Lion, the king of the bush, was sick and Lion spent sleepless nights wandering in the bush, screaming, and feeling the agony of the cub's sickness.
Lion made unsuccessful attempts to find the right treatment for the sickness but could not find any. Instead the sickness remained unknown. 

Lion decided to call on a meeting of all its associates in the search of the cub's therapy.
Every species of animals sent its medical specialist to the meeting.
The council of the wise was made up of Leopard, Gazelle, Fox, Elephant, Zebra, Warthog, and other animals.
The meeting was not a success and the sickness kept getting worse. 

As the specialists run out of options, the fox wanted to revenge against the porcupine because of the animosity between them.
The Fox suggested to the Lion: <q>Your Highness, I came here after a long journey that helped me to learn about different types of medicine; thus, I would like to recommend a medicine.</q>

The Lion urged the Fox saying: <q>Why would you wait for this long?</q>
The fox then said: <q>Wound the porcupine, then give some of its blood to the cub, and we will work on feeding the cub afterwards.</q>

As the porcupine heard that it got too scared.
Then the porcupine went straight to the Lion and said:

> Your highness, I cannot let your cub die but I cannot really cure him.
> Your cub's life has more worth than mine.
> I came knowing the medicine too.
> But the fox forgot one important thing about it.
> I will even tell you where we got the medicine from: When we were coming to the meeting, we met those who walk by two legs, and they told us that the medicine will come from the both of us.
> They will have to find the brain of the fox, and mix it with the blood of the porcupine; the cub will drink them and will recover.

Then, they cut off the head of the fox, sliced it in portions and removed the brain.
They suck blood from the porcupine and gave the mixture to the cub.

That was the end of the meeting: The porcupine was not walking properly as it always moved, as it had been beaten a few days before then in the cassava plantations.

After two days, the cub passed away.
