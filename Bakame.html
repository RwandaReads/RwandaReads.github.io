    <h1> Bakame and the Hyena </h1>
  </header>
<p>
  Long ago, Bakame was friends with a hyena; they had drunk each other’s blood as a sign of friendship.
  They went on like that for years but Bakame did not feel at ease.
  He was sad because the hyena was wealthier than he was. 
</p>
<p>
  One morning, Bakame said to the hyena, <q>let us start a business of selling skins so that you become even richer that you already are. There is but one obstacle though: I do not have a capital. Lend me some and I will pay you back with interest.</q>
</p>
<p>
  The hyena found it a good plan and agreed to everything Bakame said.
</p>
<p>
  They started selling skins and when the skins became very many.
  Bakame and the hyena decided to start selling them abroad.
  In the meantime, Bakame kept all the income.
</p>
<p>
  After Bakame had become well-off, it pretended to be sick.
  The business stopped but the hyena did not pay close attention to that. 
</p>
<p>
  A few days later, Bakame woke up very early and went to the hyena’s home.
</p>
<p>
  <q>Hello there! Good morning to you all!</q> Bakame said
</p>
<p>
  <q>Morning, Bakame! How are you?</q> the hyena replied.
</p>
<p>
  Bakame thought for a while and said, <q>I am not fine at all, my friend. We have been robbed last night. The thieves took all our possessions. I barely made it out alive.</q>
</p>
<p>
  Upon hearing that, the hyena froze as though it had been struck by a lightning.
  When Bakame saw that the hyena was so devastated, he went on and deluded his friend that he will pay everything.
  <q>Worry not. I will work to give you back what I owe you.</q>
</p>
<p>
  Bakame went back, dug a pool and started raising fish in it.
  After some time, when the fish had grown, Bakame went to fish them and ate alone.
</p>
<p>
  A month later, the hyena went to Bakame to claim what Bakame owed him.
  Bakame received him well.
  He went to his pool, got ten fish, cooked them so well and made a delicious soup out of them.
  When the hyena tasted the soup, he was so caught in the moment and forgot why he was there. 
</p>
<p>
  Instead, he asked, <q>tell me Bakame, where do you get a soup this delicious from?</q>
</p>
<p>
  Then Bakame took the hyena to its pool and said, <q>go and dig a pool just like this one, the fish will come naturally.</q>
</p>
<p>
  When the hyena reached home, it dug its whole land in a heartbeat.
  After irrigating, it waited for the fish to come but they did not.
  Then, it went back to Bakame’s place very pissed at him.
  Reaching there, Bakame made it taste to the unbelievably sweet wine that it had made and the hyena immediately fell in a state of ecstasy.
  It even forgot why it was there in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  <q>Oh my! Now, where did you find this wine?</q> Said the hyena.
</p>
<p>
  <q>Remember that banana farm that you have? Go, cut all of it, and put the sticky substance in a container for three weeks. After you do all that, taste and you will tell me about it.</q> Bakame replied.
</p>
<p>
  The Hyena went and did as Bakame said.
  Three weeks later, he tasted the wine but it did not go as it had expected.
  It felt as if its tongue had caught fire.
  Feeling very angry at Bakame, the hyena took a bag and went straight to Bakame’s home.
  Arriving at Bakame's, it took Bakame and put him in the bag so that it goes to throw him in a valley.
  On its way, it remembered that it forgot something at Bakame's home.
  It hid the bag somewhere on the road and went back running. 
</p>
<p>
  It happened that a deer passed nearby where the hyena had hidden the bag. 
</p>
<p>
  <q>Hello deer!</q> Said Bakame
</p>
<p>
  <q>Hey Bakame! What on earth are you doing in that bag?</q> asked the deer
</p>
<p>
  Bakame sighed and said, <q>Mine is a long and complicated story. The one who put me in this bag wants to go and throne me so that I become king of all these animals. However, I don’t want to be king. I have said it over and over but no one listens to me.</q>
</p>
<p>
  The deer thought for a second and went like, <q>Whaaat! Such a blessing that you are refusing. Let me take your place if you do not wish to be king.</q>
</p>
<p>
  Bakame refused at first, but finally said, <q>Okay... come in and take my place but you owe me!</q>
  The deer removed Bakame from the bag and went in instead.
  Bakame then said, <q>I am going to announce your arrival.</q>
</p>
<p>
  Shortly after, the hyena came back and resumed its journey.
  The hyena felt that the bag was heavy and thought, <q>What did he eat while I was gone? He is so heavy now!</q>
  But it was determined to kill him.
</p>
<p>
  <q>You will not fool me again, Bakame! I will not let you.</q> Said the hyena out loud.
</p>
<p>
  Upon hearing that, the deer cried, <q>I am not Bakame, put me down.</q>
  It cried a lot but the hyena would not listen.
  Instead, it replied, <q>You will not fool me again, man! Save your breath. I know how smart you are but this is your last day.</q>
  Minutes later, the hyena had reached the valley and threw the bag in it.
  The deer died instantly, without making a sound.
</p>
<p>
  The hyena went back home confident that it is going to enjoy Bakame’s fish and wine.
  When it went to Bakame’s home in the evening, it found Bakame peacefully sitting by his pool fishing. 
</p>
<p>
  Bakame saw the hyena as it set its feet at the pool. 
</p>
<p>
  <q>Beware, hyena! Those who are alive cannot come close to those who came back from the Underworld like me.</q>
  The hyena was very scared and believed that Bakame had really resurrected. It ran away and swore never to befriend Bakame again. 
</p>
<p>
  It is not I who ends, it is the tale.
