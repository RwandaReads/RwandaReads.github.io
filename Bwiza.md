# Beauty {#english}

Once upon a time there were a man and a wife and they begot a girl named Bwiza.
As she grew up her parents loved her and taught her the good manners portraying a true Rwandan Girl.
As they say her name defined her, she was beautiful as her name meant “beauty”.
She was such beautiful and charming that everyone acclaimed it by saying “Luck is the man who will marry you.”

After some days her mother felt sick and died, and her father decided to marry another woman with whom they begot two children.
As years went on, the step mother of Bwiza become more jealous of her beauty and manners that were better than her kids’.
One day the father of Bwiza decided to go for a journey in a far land to seek for better living of the family.
Since then begins troubles and agony of Bwiza.
Her step mother imposed her with tiresome work with the aim to denature her beauty.
She would sent her to fetch water, collect woods, and without a rest after she would be sent into the fields to cultivate.
She starve her the whole day without even a cup of water, but Bwiza did not grudge about it instead remained humble and respectful towards her stepmother.

The neighbours and the stepmother children noticed all of this but they could not help it.
After all despite being a tyrant the stepmother did consult witches.
She was a mean, careless, shameless woman who would join men in bars and would get drunk like them.
Whoever would try to point a finger at her was either killed by witches or drunkards from the bar.
Back home poverty rose and ravished the family because of her carelessness but Bwiza would try to find food for her two children to keep them health.
Even though she did all of this her step mother would beat her when she returned home drunk

Overtime Bwiza began to ………, and her beautiful smile start to fade.
Always with tears in the eyes and hungry, but she kept on being kind and humble towards everyone.
On day on the river where she fetched water there came a young man with a flock of cows.
He was handsome, quiet and charming.
For an instant he laid his eyes on her and their hearts felt warm and comforted.
He got closer helped her to lift her pot and asked for her name but the girl with shyness and a pretty smile she rushed without saying anything.
After that the cattle have drunk water he drove them along the way Bwiza had passed towards a nearby village hoping to meet her but she did not show up.
The following days he rotted around the village with his flocks and shepherd but Bwiza was nowhere to be found.
One da he saw a young girl who was playing near the village who happened to be the sister of Bwiza.
The young man described Bwiza to the little girl and she immediately recognize that it was Bwiza.
She went on and told the young man about the misfortune of Bwiza despite her kindness and beauty.
The young man raged at this and asked whether Bwiza had no father but the little sister said that he had gone to far to seek wealth.

All of this caused discomfort to the young man and told other shepherd to take the flocks at the king’s palace where they have came from.
He went to his father being the king and told him his journey to the village and about the misfortune of a beautiful lady he had met.
He requested the king to send messengers to seek the father of Bwiza so that he can come and save her daughter from anguish.
The king granted his wish and sent some servants to go in the far land to chase Bwiza’s father.
They finally found him in a market were he had become a trader.
They narrated the whole tragedy to the father and immediately with a sadness and sorrow went back with them.

When they got back to the village the father saw all the atrocities and misfortune his wife had brought and she was not even around.
The children had become bags of bones and he could barely recognize Bwiza.
When the prince came back in the village, he gathered the whole village for the trial of that unfaithful and careless mother in public.
The whole village claimed that she should be chased out the village and never to come back.
Her witches, children and fellow men were now against her.
She had not only spoiled her house but the entire village could no longer bear her conducts.

When she had finally left the father of Bwiza honoured and thanked the Prince for all his help but the prince insisted that It was his duty to solve the conflicts of his people.
The prince urged the father to take care of his children to his best.
Bwiza was now revived and happy for the justice made on her behalf.
Her father apologized for his absence and took the whole family back in the far land where he had become prosperous.
Bwiza grew more beautiful, respectful, charming and elegant to win a hand in a marriage of any Prince in the whole kingdom.
