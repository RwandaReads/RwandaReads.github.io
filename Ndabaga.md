No sonner was the daugher born, the man went on the battlefield to fight alongside the king.
Years elapsed but the man was not coming back home. When Ndabaga was turning six years she asked her mom whether she had a father.
Her mother with a grieving answered her that she had one, but who has long gone one the battlefield to fight on the king’s side.
The answer was not complete for the girl.
She went on again “why can’t he come back home?”
Once again with a constrained voice her mom said “Because he does not have a son who can go to succeed him on the battlefield so to retire.” This meant that her father was going to die on the war unless go there to fight in his place.

This news chocked the girl and from then she committed herself to one day to replace her father.
She starded taking boyish practice which involved shooting with an bow and an arrow, choping down trees, hunting in the forest and attending boys trainings for militia.
Day after day she became better even more than her fellow boys.
She neither miss a target nor could her miss her prey during the hunt.
She also became a good wrestler to the point of knocking down boys as sacks of hay!
Throught out this transition non except her mother knew that she was a girl.

Every years she could see boys going to the war to succeed their father and compelled her to work harder so that she may become a best worrior to become her farther’s successor.
As she grew the breast started to come out but she made sure they don’t become visible.
She did all her best to hide even a single triat of girlish and this made her the best and skilled worrior.

Finally, the time came for her to join the the crowd of people goin to the battle to succeed their fathers.
She said her goodbyes to her but left her with anguish and sorrow.
All along the way she untosided because she hid herself.
When they got on the battlefield every father was delighted to see his son enthrowning them.
Father of Ndabaga was sitting far away from the cheering group lonely and desperate.
This way Ndabaga was able to spot him out and run straight to him.
She introduceed herself anf told him how she was able to get there after series of a tremendous traing dedicated to boys.
This aroused tears in her father’s face who was so much worried about the secrifices her daughter had made.
At last the old man could take his way back home that he had left for almost twenty years.

On the battlefield Ndabaga become a successful warrior who would conquer the enemy in blink of eye.
She was treasured by his cohorts who fought by her side.
Nevertheless none of them knew that she was a girl.
When it came to the time of bathing, Ndabaga would go in a secret and hidden place on near the river bank where she would bath unnoticed.

She went on and told the king the whole journey she made so as to become her father’s successor.
The king was amazed and shocked by the girl’s bravely.
Despite all of these the king found her beautiful and married her.
